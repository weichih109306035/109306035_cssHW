<div style="color: lightgreen">
A public memorial service was held on February 24 <a>(2/24, marking both Kobe's and Gianna's jersey numbers)</a> at Staples Center with Jimmy Kimmel hosting. Speakers at the service included Vanessa, Jordan, O'Neal, Diana Taurasi, and Geno Auriemma.<br>

<span class="C">The NBA had postponed the Lakers' game against the Clippers just two days after the accident on January 28 – the first time an NBA game had been postponed for any reason since the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing led to the postponement of a Celtics game</span>>. On January 30, the first game after the crash was played at Staples Center between the Clippers and the Kings, the Clippers honored Bryant before the game, with Southern California native Paul George narrating a video tribute to Bryant. The next day, the Lakers played their first game after the crash against the Trail Blazers. Ahead of the match, the Lakers paid tribute to Bryant and all who lost their lives in the crash with a ceremony held just before tip off, with Usher singing <span class="A">"Amazing Grace"</span> and Boyz II Men singing the <span class="A">National Anthem</span>, while Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth reunited to perform <span class="A">"See You Again"</span> – originally their tribute to Paul Walker after his death while filming Furious 7 – at halftime. James also delivered a speech to the crowd before the game, and every player in the Lakers starting lineup was announced with Bryant's name. The game was the second-most-watched in ESPN history, averaging 4.41 million viewers.<br>
<p>
Also, beginning with the Spurs and the Raptors in their game in San Antonio on the day of the crash, teams paid tribute to Bryant at the start of their games with intentional on-court violations referring to his uniform numbers on their first possession – either a <span class="B">24-second shot clock</span> or an <span class="B">8-second backcourt violation</span>. On February 15, NBA commissioner Adam Silver announced that the All-Star Game MVP Award would be renamed to the NBA All-Star Game Kobe Bryant Most Valuable Player in Bryant's honor. In May 2020, the Mamba Sports Academy was renamed to Sports Academy out of respect for Bryant.</p>
